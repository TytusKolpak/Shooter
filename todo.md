1. After a shutdown leave the bolt where it hit and enable its pickup to refill ammo
2. Power ups
3. Scores?
4. What's up with this controller disconnection?
5. Start making documentation
6. Maybe integrate some tests into the project

## How to approach documentation

> If I would start again I would likely create a documentation right from the beginning and update it immediately when a reason for it arises.
>
> I would also write down and explain with example all the repeating patten that i use now to organize the code and for every other major topic
>
> This would all work for me later as a reference and a template to reuse so that I can ensure some level of uniformity and clearness , so tha this project is easy to modify and understand
>
> \- me from before

And take a look at automatic documentation generation from Go
