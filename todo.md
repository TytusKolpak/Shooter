> If I would start again I would likely create a documentation right from the beginning and update it immediately when a reason for it arises.
>
> I would also write down and explain with example all the repeating patten that i use now to organize the code and for every other major topic
>
> This would all work for me later as a reference and a template to reuse so that I can ensure some level of uniformity and clearness , so tha this project is easy to modify and understand
>
> \- me from before
